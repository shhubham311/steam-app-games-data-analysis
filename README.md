In this project, I have used the following resources:

Dataset: Steam Store Games - The data set contains a comprehensive list of games available on the Steam platform. The data is publicly available on Kaggle.

Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Scipy and Matplotlib - These Python libraries were used to clean, manipulate, and visualize the data.

Reference: https://docs.python.org/ - website from where I understood about the libraries and python.

Tools: Jupyter Notebook and Microsoft Excel - These tools were used to develop and present the project.
